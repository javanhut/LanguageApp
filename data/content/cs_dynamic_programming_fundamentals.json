  "significance": "Dynamic Programming is like having a perfect memory for problem-solving. Instead of solving the same subproblems over and over, you remember the solutions and reuse them. This technique powers everything from GPS route optimization to DNA sequence analysis to financial modeling. It's the difference between a solution that takes years to compute and one that finishes in seconds.",

      "significance": "The key insight behind dynamic programming is recognizing when a big problem contains repeated smaller problems. Once you see this pattern, you can avoid redundant work by remembering solutions. This shift in thinking - from 'solve everything from scratch' to 'remember and reuse' - is fundamental to efficient algorithm design.",
